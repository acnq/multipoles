# Prepare the charge distribution dict for the MultipoleExpansion object:

charge_dist = {
    'discrete': True,     # point charges are discrete charge distributions
    'charges': [
        {'q': 1, 'xyz': (0, 0, 1)},
        {'q': -1, 'xyz': (0, 0, -1)},
    ]
}

l_max = 2   # where to stop the infinite multipole sum; here we expand up to the quadrupole (l=2)

Phi = MultipoleExpansion(charge_dist, l_max)

# We can evaluate the multipole expanded potential at a given point like this:

x, y, z = 30.5, 30.6, 30.7
value = Phi(x, y, z)

# The multipole moments are stored in a dict, where the keys are (l, m) and the values q_lm:
Phi.multipole_moments
print(Phi.multipole_moments)
